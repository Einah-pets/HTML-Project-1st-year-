      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        I am the oldest sibling in my family. I have one younger brother whose
        name is Steven. He is 16 and he is in his last year of high school. My
        parents are both Chinese. However, they were born in Tahiti and they are
        4th or 5th generation immigrants. On my mother’s side, all family
        members live in Tahiti. As a result, I almost see them everyday and we
        are very close. My father’s family lives in New Caledonia. Despite the
        distance, we try to keep in touch via calls and emails. We sometimes fly
        to Noumea to visit my grand parents on special occasions. Moreover, I
        also have family living in France, in the United States and in Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up around Chinese community and traditions. Every year, for the
        Chinese New Year celebrations, the whole family gathers for a gigantic
        feast. We cook a myriad of delicious Chinese specialties such as
        dumplings, roast duck, char siu, braised pork, steamed fish and so on.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I went to La Mennais high school in Papeete. After graduating, I decided
        to pursue my studies at
        <a href="https://www.insearch.edu.au/programs" class="uni"
          >UTS Insearch</a
        >.
      </p>
      <div style="float: left; text-align: center; width: 200px">
        <img src="Assets/Bitmoji Study.png" width="90%" style="border: double 3px" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Several factors impacted my decision. First of all, there are only a few
        options of university courses offered in Tahiti. But none of them was
        matching with my career choice. Therefore, I decided to explore overseas
        options. I wanted to study overseas because I believed that it would
        give me experience and maturity. Besides, I have always loved travelling
        and discovering new places. Australia was a great choice for me as it is
        relatively close from home. Also, studying in Australia gives me the
        opportunity to practise my English skills which is a valuable asset in
        today’s society.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>

      <p>
        I like to spend my free time reading adventure books and mystery novels.
        I like to immerse in the story and soak up the atmosphere described in
        the book as I progress in the chapters. Once, I was able to finish a
        book in only 2 days. No sooner had I started reading the first words of
        the book than I could not let go of it. In my childhood, I also
        practiced multiple extracurricular activities such as tennis, swimming,
        chess, pottery, dance, gymnastics, and judo. I really enjoyed trying out
        all of these, but along the years I took a higher interest in dancing,
        especially ballet.

        <br />I also like to listen to music a lot.
      </p>
      <div style="float: right; text-align: center; width: 200px">

      </div>
      <p>
        It often allows me to relax after a busy day at school for example. I
        listen to various styles of music, from the last pop trend to the
        classical opera pieces. I like to extend my musical repertoire and to
        discover new pieces. My favourite instrument to listen to is piano. I
        find the sound of this instrument very versatile as it can be powerful
        and emphatic but also soothing and mellifluous. Among the pianists that
        I admired,
