	<p>I was born in Papeete, capital city of <font style="font-family:forte; font-size:xx-large; font-style:bold; color:red">Tahiti</font>, the main island of <font style="font-family:forte; font-size:xx-large; font-style:bold; color:red">French Polynesia</font>. <br>
French Polynesia is an overseas collectivity of France. It includes five archipelagos: the Austral, the Marquesas, the Gambier, the Tuamotu and The Society. Overall, French Polynesia comprises more than a hundred islands and spreads over more than two thousand kilometres. The official language of Tahiti is French.

	<p>French Polynesia is a small country of around 300,000 inhabitants. In Tahiti, the island where I lived, the total population is 130,000 inhabitants. As a result, Tahiti can be considered as a close-knit community where everybody knows each other. Tahitian people are usually known for being bon vivant and welcoming.

	<p>Tahiti’s flora is very rich. It includes a multitude of native species such as the Opuhi flower, the Tiare Tahiti, the frangipani and so on. As tradition requires, Tahitians always welcome visitors with a wreath of flowers. Nature is omnipresent in Tahiti. Tahitian scenery is multifaceted and includes rainforests, beaches, rivers, waterfalls, mountains… Most people live on the coastline, surrounded by the ocean on one side and the mountain on the other.	</p>

	<h2>Tradition and culture</h2>
	
	<p>In addition to heavenly beaches and palm trees, the name “Tahiti” may also evoke Tahitian dance. Also known as Ori Tahiti, this dance is characterised by repeated motions of the hips, either sideways or in circles. Dancers traditionally wear vegetal outfits made of leaves, plant fibres and flowers. Moreover, dance is always tightly connected with music. Tahitian dance can be accompanied by ukuleles and traditional drums such as pahu or tōʻere. In the Tahitian culture, dance is meant to tell stories, especially ancient legends and mythologies. Thus, the gestures of the dancers often have a special significance as well.

	<p>Tahitian dance is very popular around the world as well as on the island itself. It holds such a central place in the Tahitian culture that is taught in local schools as part of the curriculum. Tahitian students can even choose it as a module when taking their HSC. Besides, every year is organised the <a href="https://www.heiva.org/en/home/">Heiva i Tahiti</a> which is an international dance festival, gathering hundreds of local and overseas dancers. The Heiva is a annual highlight of Tahitian culture and a beloved event for all Tahitian people. 
	</p>
	<p>Another famous dance that also belongs to the Tahitian heritage is fire dance. This particular dance involves blazing sticks that are being swirled and thrown in the air. This dance is usually performed at night, to emphasise the radiance of the fire.
